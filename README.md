# Meteor
Visualization of meteor landings, as provded by NASA Data. 

### Why?
When I as younger I had a strong fascination with space. That fascination has remained with me, and upon discovering NASA's open datasets, I thought I 
could have some with them.

### What, exactly, does it do?
When you visit the page, it'll begin loading NASA's dataset on meteor landings on earth. From there, it will plot the landing zone on the map. 
If you hover over a point and click the "pop-up", a sidebar bar will appear with **basic** information about the meteor landing. My hope for extending this 
project is to use something like the Wikipedia API to load additional information or images about the meteor in the sidebar.

### TODO:
* Improve the UI/UX
    +Like make the points circles, instead of squares
    +Make, I don't know, colorful
* "Datamining" additional information for the sidebar
